# VATPAC-vATIS-files
vATIS Composite files for use within the VATPAC division

NOTE: There are two sets of files in this repository. If you are still using the original beta, use the beta 1 files. If you are on the newer version, use the beta 2 files. Beta 1 files will eventually be removed.


## How to setup
1. To have multiple files, you will need to make a new profile in vATIS.
vATIS 4.0 can be downloaded from https://github.com/vatis-project/vatis/releases

2. click the 'new' button, and set a name for your profile. I suggest setting it to the ENR position you are controlling.
3. click 'manage profile' in the top left.
4. click 'manage composite' then 'import'.
5. select the files for the ATIS's you would like.

## How to connect
Select a preset from the dropdown down the bottom, then click connect.

The ATIS code for each airport can be seen next to the airports ICAO code.
